#### About

We have followed the paper '[Predicting Mechanical Properties from Microstructure Images in Fiber-reinforced Polymers using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03675v1.pdf)’ by Yixuan Suna, Imad Hanhanb, Michael D. Sangidb, and Guang Linc. 

This repo contains:

1.  src
    1.  slice\_sample = unzipped data, contains numpy object files
    2.  [ME793 final.ipynb](https://github.com/shruhh/ME-793-Project-Sem-8/blob/main/src/ME793%20final.ipynb) - this has the code written from scratch by us
    3.  [edited code stressNet\_2D\_v2.py](https://github.com/shruhh/ME-793-Project-Sem-8/blob/main/src/edited%20code%20stressNet_2D_v2.py) - this is the existing code we updated, to make it run. 
2.  actual paper
3.  dataset.zip - this can be downloaded if the interested need the dataset for some other problem. 
4.  zip of the entire repo - the interested can directly download this zip folder. Unzip it. And, run the files within.
5.  Presentation PDF
